I am open to contributions and you could contribute in many ways:

  - Request features
  - Submit bug reports
  - Submit pull requests
  - Help by answering issues
  - Tell us if you are using the plugin and the project

Just a few guidelines (for now):

 - Follow the existing conventions (if unsure, make an issue)
 - Ensure dist and js/css dirs are kept uptodate with each other
 - Minify using https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home (no custom options)
